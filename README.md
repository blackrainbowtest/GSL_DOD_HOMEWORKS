1. Find the Tuple with the Maximum Sum 
Task: 
Given a list of tuples where each tuple 
contains three integers, find the tuple with the maximum sum of its elements. 
Example: 
Input: tuples_list = [(1, 2, 3), (4, 1, 2), (2, 2, 2)] 
Output: (4, 1, 2) 
Explanation: 
The sum of elements of each tuple is calculated, and the tuple with the highest sum is returned. In this case, (4, 1, 2) has the maximum sum of 7. 
Instructions: 
- Implement a function to find the tuple with the maximum sum. 
- You can use built-in functions to help with the calculation. 
2. Largest Palindromic Number in a Range 
Task: 
Given two integers `start` and `end`, find the largest palindromic number within this range (inclusive). 
Example: 
Input: start = 100, end = 200 
Output: 191 
Explanation: Among the numbers from 100 to 200, the largest palindromic number is 191.

Instructions: 
- Implement a function to find the largest palindromic number within the given range. 
- A palindromic number is a number that 
remains the same when its digits are 
reversed. Here are some examples of palindromic numbers (77, 99, 121, 232, 777,

181,898) 
The function should return none if no 
palindromic number exists within the range
