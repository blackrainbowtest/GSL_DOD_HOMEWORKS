Task 1: Sort by String Length
Write a function that takes a list of strings inputted by the user and returns a new list
that contains the same strings, but sorted by their length in ascending order.
Expected outputs for various inputs:
Input: "apple, pie, banana, pear" => Output: ["pie", "pear", "apple", "banana"]
Input: "a, abc, ab" => Output: ["a", "ab", "abc"]
Input: "longest, long, longer" => Output: ["long", "longer", "longest"]
Input: "one, two, three, four" => Output: ["one", "two", "four", "three"]

Task 2: Find Prime Numbers
Write a function that finds all prime numbers between 0 and 100. A prime number is a
whole number greater than 1 that can only be divided evenly by 1 and itself. This
means it has no other divisors (numbers that can be multiplied to get the original
number).
For example:
 2 is a prime number because it can only be divided by 1 and 2.
 3 is a prime number because it can only be divided by 1 and 3.
 4 is not a prime number because it can be divided by 1, 2, and 4.
 5 is a prime number because it can only be divided by 1 and 5.

Expected output:
[2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89,
97]
